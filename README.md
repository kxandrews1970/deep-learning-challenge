# deep-learning-challenge
Mod21
This challenge has us using dklean to train models and split the data into training and testing datasets and compile the model. i looked at https://github.com/StanJohn04/funding-predictions/blob/main/Funding%20Analysis/ when i got lost.  It will take more than a week for this deep learning stuff to take root.  i started another attempt to get a better analysis towards the end of the code.
